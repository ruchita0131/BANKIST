Bankist - A Minimalist Banking Application
This project is a client-side simulation of a modern banking application, built to demonstrate advanced JavaScript concepts, DOM manipulation, and data management. It provides a functional interface for users to manage their fictional accounts.

Note: This is a front-end demonstration and does not connect to a real banking back-end. All user data is for demonstration purposes only.
